      <description>Ever pondered the natural order of reducing risk in InfoSec or the natural order of working towards compliance? It’s something I’ve been thinking about lately. Maybe it’s related to the recurring conversation my wife and I have on the topic of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

I eventually came to the realization that I wanted to do other things and maintaining a blog wasn’t one of them.</description>
