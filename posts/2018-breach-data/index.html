</blockquote>

<p>Some advice on preventing about 70% of the incidents I see over in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/securitybreach/">/r/securitybreach</a>, a sub reddit started to help answer the questions: What&rsquo;s the enemy after? How do they go about trying to get it?</p>

<h2 id="account-compromise">Account Compromise</h2>

<p>Approximately 30% of the incidents I’ve seen stem from an Account Compromise: Credentials were compromised and now there&rsquo;s unauthorized access to data.</p>

<p>The tactics are basic password spraying: Grab a combo list like Exploit.in and <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/new-type-brute-force-attack-office-365-accounts/">spray those creds across multiple targets.</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of ways to mitigate. If I could only recommend 1 way, hands down, it would be MFA. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/">U2F</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/authentication/otp-policies.html">TOTP</a> &gt; Any MFA &gt; no MFA. Don&rsquo;t over think MFA,  just enable it everywhere you can.</p>

<h2 id="broken-access-control">Broken Access Control</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Nobody wants to hack us”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About 20% of incidents are due to broken access control, yet there’s more to the story and the motivation is possibly more interesting. The majority of broken access control incidents I&rsquo;ve seen are schadenfruede motivated.</p>

<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t process credit cards or crypto currency. Maybe you don&rsquo;t store any personal data. Doesn&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s a company or consultant out there looking for press and they&rsquo;d love to find your <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/21/aws_s3_alteryx_bungle/">open S3 bucket</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/">elastic search db</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/kars4kids-data-breach/">mongodb</a>.</p>

<p>How are you doing on those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CIS_Critical_Security_Controls_for_Effective_Cyber_Defense">SANS Critical Security Controls</a>? Number 1 is inventory. You can’t protect what you can’t see. Simply running <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2">Scout2</a> and acting on that insight would prevent 50% or more of the Broken Access Control incidents I see.</p>

<h2 id="insufficient-logging-monitoring">Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring</h2>

<p>Over 40% of incidents are money related and about 30% are after credit card data. Magecart actors have found a chink in the PCI armor and it’s called javascript includes.
How does it work? Simple: Compromise javascript included on a checkout page and siphon off credit card data.</p>

<p>This one, sorry, I don&rsquo;t have concrete insight into Magecart tactics. I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that there&rsquo;s not a strong culture of peer reviews or CI/CD in the victim environments.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/the-three-r-s-of-enterprise-security-rotate-repave-and-repair-f64f6d6ba29d">3 Rs</a> create an environment that&rsquo;s inhospitable to unauthorized changes and a culture of <a href="https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/agile-code-review-process/">peer reviews</a> ensures a minimum of 2 people understand the change.</p>

<p>At the least, make sure you have sufficient logging &amp; monitoring in place to know when a change happened, authorized or not.</p>

<h2 id="apt-tactics">APT Tactics</h2>

<p>APT, maybe a nation state figured it out but now every script kiddie knows how to do it. I find APT tactics interesting, partially due to the asymmetric problem of defense, partially because &ndash; thanks to open source tooling &ndash; the methods are easy to execute, and mostly because it&rsquo;s a great example of turning your enemies strength (Active Directory) into their weakness.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html">The Art of War</a> is possibly the best security book written. OK, back to APT.</p>

<p>The one thing I&rsquo;d recommend: Run through it yourself in your environment. Once you see how it’s done you will “know the enemy” and can leverage what you know about your environment &ndash; know thyself &ndash; to implement IOCs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple receipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Metasploit as your C&amp;C</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn">Unicorn</a> to generate a payload with a good chance of avoiding AV detection.</li>
<li>Find a list of targets on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Phish your list. Email them a link to your Unicorn payload and a simple message to trick them into running.</li>
<li>Now you’re on the network. Use <a href="https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire">powershell empire</a> to find a logged in domain admin.</li>
<li>Game over</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-s-that-sound">What&rsquo;s that sound?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s old hats &ndash; grey beards? &ndash; grumbling: Nothing new here, old news. Maybe, but if it&rsquo;s old news then why&rsquo;s it still effective?  Incident trend data shouldn&rsquo;t be the domain of marketing teams trying to push the next silver bullet. Help me out over in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/securitybreach/">/r/securitybreach</a>.</p>
