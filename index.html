          Should I quit my job?
It’s day one of DevSecCon Seattle and Tanya Janca has just wrapped up her Keynote “Security is everybody’s job”. Tanya asks for questions and the first question is: “I don’t feel like my company takes security seriously, should I quit my job?”. Tanya’s answer to the question was: “Yeah, quit your job. There’s plenty of job openings out there. Why stay there?”
Wait, what? I thought Tanya was a DevSecOps champion.

          How is it a single bad actor could gain access to the data of over 100 million credit applicants when that data should have been protected by a company with the resources of over 45,000 employees? What superpowers did that single bad actor have that none of those 45,000 employees possessed? It turns out that bad actor, Paige Thompson, didn’t have any super powers. It turns out Paige could OODA Loop faster than Capital One and all of it’s 45,000 employees.

          American car manufacturers found themselves caught off guard when they started to lose market share in the 80s. Americans were losing to Japanese manufacturers who could offer something they couldn’t: both price and quality. How did the Japanese do it? The Americans wanted to figure it out so they sent analysts to Japan where something curious happened, the Japanese welcomed them with open arms. It seems the Japanese were excited to share what they had learned.

          Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets - W. Edwards Deming
Seems most in the tech world have heard of DevOps, but never Deming - the father of quality. Deming’s ideas were the catalyst for Lean Manufacturing, and in turn DevOps to DevSecOps. While many of us have heard “Security is everyone’s job” we don’t know it’s borrowed from Deming’s quote: Quality is everyone’s job. Did you know he was primarily addressing management with that quote?

          If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold. @andlewis
If you asked me: What company has full access to un-hashed passwords, email accounts, social media accounts and location data, for the sole purpose of monetizing that data, on over 1 million people around the globe? Until a few days ago I’d answer: Google maybe, but don&rsquo;t they hash/salt passwords?
Let’s back up a bit.

          Have you ever witnessed a broken process that was obviously broken and doomed fail? Not because it couldn’t work. The process would never work simply because the owner of the process was blind to why it didn’t work: The human factor. I’ve seen this in security all too often. We often want to ignore how our brains work and blame the training or blame human nature. Proposed fixes are often more training or threats of termination.

          Need to be PCI, CJIS, or NIST 800-53 compliant? If so, Security Awareness Training (SAT) isn’t optional. What if you’re not bound by those security requirements? What if you could take a pragmatic approach and do it, not because you have to; rather, your only motivation is to reduce risk.
Let’s say you’re launching a new cryptocurrency exchange. You’re not bound by any compliance requirement, but, you’re also a major target.

          Who hates uptime? If we’re talking system uptime, then yeah, this guy hates uptime. Service uptime? Love it.
Metrics? Love those also. My favorite metrics are aggregates. I love single values that can tell a story. Uptime is one of the best aggregates. Uptime tells us the obvious: How long has it been up? It also tells us the not so obvious: How good are we at patching systems and how good are we at designing resilient services?

          We have a coding skill set requirement for engineering candidates at The Trade Desk. It’s a requirement for everyone from our DBAs to our Information Security Engineers.
I can probably guess what you may be thinking. Let’s get some common arguments out of the way.
“Software Engineers should focus on writing code. Let me focus on my discipline”
“There’s a shortage of InfoSec candidates. Why further limit the talent pool?”
