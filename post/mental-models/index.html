  <p>Is Youtube machine learning drawing a connection between Steve Jobs and DevOps? Is that why Youtube keeps recommending a Steve Jobs related video after I watch a DevOps related video?</p>
<p>Maybe Youtube is on to something. I had an aha moment after watching an interview with Andy Miller about the Apple acquisition of his company, Quattro Wireless. Andy talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/k7f-51oy0OA?t=2047">Steve’s constant demands to simplify</a>, and his advice to Andy: “<a href="https://youtu.be/k7f-51oy0OA?t=2129">Use a picture. I don’t want to see a deck with a hundred words on it. I want you to think like an Apple guy</a>”.</p>
<p>A light bulb went off when I heard that. It&rsquo;s the same problem Peter Drucker talks about in The Fifth Discipline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the single greatest liability of management teams is that they confront complex, dynamic realities with a language designed for simple, static problems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m lucky to work at a company that’s both global, and decentralized. Our HQ is in Ventura California, but only a fraction of our company calls California home. We’re all over the world. I may start my day on a Zoom with somebody in London and may end it on a Zoom with somebody in Shanghai. In many ways our offices are perks, they’re not required; so when the pandemic hit, it was barely a speedbump.</p>
<p>I don’t need to be in an office to get things done, but there’s one office tool that’s been hard to replace: The whiteboard. Sometimes it’s hard to figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/kTcRRaXV-fg">who’s on first</a> over Slack or Zoom. Sometimes it’s easier to say “Let’s whiteboard this” and hours of potential conversation are distilled down to a diagram of who’s on first. Take a picture of that diagram and there’s exponential ROI as the output of the mind meld is shared with a global team.</p>
<p><img src="/mind-meld.png" alt="mind meld"></p>
<p>How do you boil complex topics down to an image, when there’s no whiteboard to share? I&rsquo;ve tried to whiteboard over Zoom, just isn&rsquo;t the same. It&rsquo;s clunky and less interactive. What works? Let’s walk through a complex topic using some alternative tools, but let’s start by exploring the topic without them. Let’s say we’re on a Zoom with the CEO and the CISO of a company that’s cleaning up from a ransomware incident. The CEO is trying to figure out what’s needed to prevent another incident.</p>
<p>Maybe the conversation goes like this:</p>
<p>CEO: How did ransomware get on our network?</p>
<p>CISO: Eric in HR opened a phishing attachment and it spread from there.</p>
<p>CEO: Eric in HR is an idiot who can’t spot obvious phishing, fire him. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Problem solved, or an example of what Peter Drucker was describing? The CEO is confronting a complex problem with language designed for a simple problem? Does the CEO have an accurate mental model from that simple conversation? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2020/05/12/ransomware-hits-pitney-bowes-for-second-time-in-less-than-a-year/?sh=14ae094c2d35">Same mistake Pitney Bowes made</a>?</p>
<p>What if the CEO explored past the first order problem of Eric falling for phishing? What if the CEO asked for a sequence diagram of events first?</p>
<p><img src="/ransomware-sequence-diagram.png" alt="ransomware sequence diagram"></p>
<p>The sequence diagram helps us see there’s a bigger problem beyond the first order problem of Eric falling for phishing. How can we understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s behind ransomware?</li>
<li>Why are they doing it?</li>
<li>How are they doing it?</li>
<li>Who are they targeting?</li>
</ul>
<p>When we start to explore and capture in a mind mapping tool we’ll end up with something like this that <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/X8u81lJoLC5D-gR6/t/-/de76c0a8c13ac723f6a788f4e4f05a9fe2d46a1da3d24b4f39eee93f20a658e4">we can share with the team to explore</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/ransomware-mind-map.png" alt="ransomware mind map"></p>
<p>That mapping helps us understand how it works. It gives us some insight into birds eye view cause and effect relationships, but doesn’t help us understand why we’re vulnerable - we need a Current Reality Tree.</p>
<p><img src="/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="current reality tree"></p>
<p><a href="https://ericalexander.org/post/devops-and-ransomware/">Check out this past blog post</a> if you’d like to understand how the current reality tree was built and how to use it.</p>
<p>What works better? Hours of back and forth over Slack or Zoom discussing a complex problem or an infographic that everyone can understand in minutes?</p>
<p>Tools I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sequencediagram.org/">Sequence Diagram</a></li>
<li><a href="https://coggle.it/">Mind Map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.simplediagrams.com/">Current Reality Tree</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Interested in learning more about DevOps and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book. Send me an <a href="mailto:devops.book@ericalexander.org?subject=book&amp;body=Let%20me%20know%20when%20it's%20out">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericalexanderorg">LinkedIn</a> if you’re interested in the book.</p>
